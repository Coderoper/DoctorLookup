## Description
A program that returns a list of doctors given a medical issue.
* 1. User inputs medical issue
* 2. User can see a list of doctors in Seattle

## Specs
* 1. A user should be able to to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Seattle area that fit the search query.
* 2. If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).
* 3. If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.
* 4. If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)
